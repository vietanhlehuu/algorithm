# Find all sum combinations

Given a positive integer, `target`, print all possible combinations of positive integers that add to the target number.

The output will be in the form a list of lists or an array of arrays, as each element in the list will be another list containing a possible sum combination.

For example, if you are given input `5`, these are the possible sum combinations.

```
1, 4
2, 3
1, 1, 3
1, 2, 2
1, 1, 1, 2
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
```
