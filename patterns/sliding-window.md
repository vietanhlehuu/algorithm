# Sliding Window

> Question 14 -> 23

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.

We will apply the Sliding Window approach to solve a few problems.

In some problems, the size of the sliding window is not fixed. We have to expand or shrink the window based on the problem constraints.

Normally, we will have 2 variables: startWindow and endWindow. We will try to move these two var (slide window) to get the result.
