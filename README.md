# Algorithms

1/ Think about error cases first

2/ It's not necessary to use 1 loop to get O(n) time complexity, we can use many loops (not nested)

3/ It's not necessary to use 1 variable to get O(1) space complexity, we can use many variables as long as it's needed

4/ Think about greedy

5/ Think about sort

6/ Think about using hash table, stack, queue

7/ Think about binary search
